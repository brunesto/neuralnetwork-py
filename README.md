# neuralnetwork-py

This is a simple neural network in python. There are 2 implementations: Bare python or using numpy. The activation function is the same for all layers.

It contains code to run against 3 different datasets:
  - iris flower samples
  - simple 1 dimensional function, to check that it can learn (regress) any function shape. 
  - MNIST handwritting samples
