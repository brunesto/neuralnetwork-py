  Also a bit of proper AI help comes in handy: there was a bug in the derivation of bias in the 1st version of backtracking, ChatGPT found it

 done:
 * forward cost
 * simple backtracking
 * classes

 todos:
 

 * try on 1 dimensional function, check that it can learn any
 * try to make it a tiny bit faster (compile?)
 * try on handwritting samples

 * switch to a proper library, in order to move on
